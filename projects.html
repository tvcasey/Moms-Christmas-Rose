                        <p>This scenario includes an inventory of traits and demographics about a group of people found in a generic database.
                            Information is tabulated into attributes so that answers may be ascertained later on to find specific information mainly
                            based on traits and relationships.  There is a lot of prompts for information and switch cases as well as functions that 
                            organize and disseminate data for the user.

                        <p>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK (RPSLS)</p>
                        <P>This game comes from the common children's hand gesture game rock, paper, scissors where each can win and each can lose based on order and type.
                            Having five options increases the complexity, but it is easily solved by using a random calculator against an array for each player and then
                            deciding victory over a series of five gestures.
                        </P>
