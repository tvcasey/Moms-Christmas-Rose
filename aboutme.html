        <p>This is a test to see where this damn text actually goes.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of differing experiences in many different fields, including accounting, industrial
            production, and answering and fixing software issues for a Fortune 500 company.
        </p>
        <p>My education consists of two bachelor degrees in history and accounting as well as over a dozen graduate courses in accounting and history.
            I have always enjoyed pursuing higher education.  To try machining I attained a CNC machinist certification was a success in the field for
            a short time.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a new member of the Knight's of Columbus, which is a Catholic service organization that encourages good ethics, hardwork, and Christain service.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I'm taking a coding bootcamp from devCodeCamp, which has a great track record of producing qualified web developers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
            Well more than four out of five candidates find jobs in their fields just after graduation.  I plan on graduating at the end of December, 2020.
